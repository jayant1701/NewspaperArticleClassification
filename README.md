# NewspaperArticleClassification
We are using a 20_newspaper database to train this model, it contains 20,000 newspaper articles of different categories
In this project we are comparing the accuracy of hand-coded multinomial bayes theorem with multinomial naive bayes classifier from sckikit-learn

One of the challenging parts was to loop through 20,000 files which are distributed over 20 folders.We used os module for it.One of the most creative solutions to the problem 
that I have ever encountered in my coding journey.I would really it if yoou you could go through the solution,i have used 2 nested loops.

following that extracting useful data from files ,cleaning it and doing NLP was also very challenging especially since i decided to write every function from scartch
